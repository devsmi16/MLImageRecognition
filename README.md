# MLImageRecognition
This iOS app lets users choose an image from their photo library and uses CoreML with the Vision framework to recognize objects in the image. The app shows the confidence level of the recognition result along with the name of the object. A progress indicator is shown during the recognition process to let the user know itâ€™s working.
